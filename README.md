# Composting Process Gamification Project ðŸŽ®

## Project Overview
This project is part of an internship where I worked on gamifying the composting process using **Unreal Engine** and **Firebase**. The goal is to make composting more engaging and fun by creating a game that simulates the composting process.

### Features:
- Built using **Unreal Engine** for high-quality graphics and gameplay mechanics.
- **Firebase** integration for storing game data and progress.
- Currently includes **the first mission**, where players learn how to separate organic waste and start the composting process.
  
## Demo Video
